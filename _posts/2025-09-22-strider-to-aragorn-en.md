#### For many years, I walked under a name and an avatar that defined it.

It was a nickname that had accompanied me since my teenage years, like a worn but faithful coat. That name gave me identity on the internet, allowed me to share, learn, and grow.  

It was that of a **Ranger**, someone who lives on the edges, who watches from a distance, who acts when needed but without claiming a place at the center.  

That was me: with the energy of an 18-year-old, convinced that I had all the answers, confident in my strength and my ideas.  
And, like **_Strider_**, I never sought to be more than a wanderer.  

#### But time _transforms_.
I am no longer that young man with quick steps and a defiant gaze. Today I carry more experiences, more scars, and more questions than answers.  
I learned that life is not only black and white: _there is an invisible thread that connects those extremes_, and most of us walk upon it.  

I have seen how hard it can be to always uphold what is right, and I learned to respect those who stumble.  
Now I know that maturity is not about never making mistakes, but about **_trying again with greater wisdom_**.  


#### The **change of avatar** is not a minor gesture.
It is a conscious decision to leave one stage behind and open another. Just as Strider decided to reveal himself as **Aragorn**, today I also choose to take a step forward.  

I do not seek crowns or titles.  
I do not have certificates that validate every step.  
But I do have actions, projects, and paths walked.  
People who, without fully knowing me, respect and follow me for what I have done and continue to do.  

My change of avatar is my way of saying:  
> "I want to guide. Not because I think I am better, but because I want to give of myself and grow with you.  
> Now it is up to the community to decide whether it follows me."  


#### I do not expect applause or certainty.
I know there will be doubts about my worth, my knowledge, or even my intentions.  
But I accept that risk, because true growth does not come from staying in the shadows, but from daring to step into the light.  

I hope this path becomes a rediscovery, one that allows me to offer what I have and receive what others wish to give.  
May it not be about leading from above, but about walking **together with the community**.  


#### I do not know where this journey will take me.
I do not have all the answers, and I am glad it is that way. Because what matters is not the destination, but the learning that comes along the way.  

Today I leave the Ranger behind. Not because it weighs on me, but because it has fulfilled its purpose.  

> And I accept being **Aragorn**:  
> not as a king or savior, but as someone willing to take one more step, to take risks, to show himself, and to keep striving to build something better, with those who wish to walk beside me.  


This blog will be part of that path. A space to share not only technical knowledge but also the questions, doubts, and lessons that emerge along the way.  

If Strider was the stage of watching from afar, **Aragorn is the beginning of walking together**.
