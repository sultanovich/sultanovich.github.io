      <strong>I turn the technical challenges</strong> of information security and Unix systems <strong>into clear and applicable solutions</strong>.
      <br>
      <br>
      I promote an open source infrastructure that is accessible, reliable, and guided by ethics and community.

  I'm <strong>Pablo GonzÃ¡lez</strong>, known in the community as <strong>Sultanovich</strong>.
  <br>
  I'm currently a <em>Cloud Security &amp; DevSecOps Engineer</em> at Wazuh, where I combine my experience in information security with my passion for Unix systems and free software.

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.65; margin-bottom:20px;">
  I've been working with Unix systems and information security since <strong>2002</strong>.  
  I started as a server administrator and today I design and strengthen cloud infrastructures,  
  always prioritizing solutions based on <strong>open source</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.65; margin-bottom:20px;">
  Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve found in free software not just tools,  
  but a way to understand technology: <strong>collaborative, transparent, and ethical</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.65; margin-bottom:20px;">
  I believe security is not only about controls, but about <strong>principles and professional responsibility</strong>.  
  <br>
  Thatâ€™s why I seek to promote a technical culture that is more open and guided by integrity,  
  where knowledge is shared and solutions are built collectively.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.65; margin-bottom:20px;">
  In this blog, you'll find articles on <strong>Cloud Security</strong>, <strong>DevSecOps</strong>,  
  <strong>compliance</strong>, and open source tools such as <strong>Debian</strong>,  
  <strong>Wazuh</strong>, and <strong>Kubernetes</strong>.  
  <br>
  I also share reflections on my professional growth and the decisions that shape that path.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.65; margin-bottom:20px;">
  My goal is to keep learning, share what I know, and contribute to the <strong>open source</strong> community.  
  <br>
  I continue building this path with the aim of contributing as a <strong>mentor and open source security advocate in Latin America</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.7; margin-bottom:40px;">
  I'm passionate about <strong>science fiction</strong> (Asimov, Tolkien) and <strong>maker projects</strong>;  
  I often experiment with <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong> (and other SBCs) and <strong>self-hosting environments</strong>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify; line-height:1.7; margin-bottom:0px;">
  â˜• <strong>Thanks for visiting my blog</strong>   <br>
  I hope you find something here that helps you, inspires you,  
  or simply motivates you to keep building open and secure technology.
