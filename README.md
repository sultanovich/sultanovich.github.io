# Sultanovich — Personal Technical Blog

Welcome to my personal blog and knowledge base.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, customized for my own notes, articles, and reflections on cloud security, DevSecOps, and open source projects.
